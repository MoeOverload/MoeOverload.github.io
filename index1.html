            <p class="Sheader">
            I initially learned to program in high school, but after years absent of coding, I seemed to have forgotten it all. So I had to re-learn all of the basics.
            <br>What has pushed me to learn again was watching Pirate Software’s stream and being told I could do it by someone in a completely foreign world to me.
            <br>It was inspiring to be part of a group of people all wanting to learn and grow in a community.
            <br>So now I spend my days studying and practicing a lot. C, python, sql, html, css, JavaScript, c#, the list goes on.
            <br>I plan on posting my practice projects to <a href="https://github.com/MoeOverload">My Github</a></p>

            I have skated since I could walk, pushed by relatives I learned the art and devoted years to it.

              I love music so much I decided to pick up the bass guitar and teach myself.
              <br>I’m not the best but I’ve learned a lot of my favorite songs and am able to play them full and well!

              <br>but I’m good at what I put the effort into! I have 8 years of flooring trade experience.

              My first idea behind learning to program was to build a video game.
              <br>Just like most young men I grew up enjoying playing with my friends, enjoying many moments of great joy!
              <br>I want to be able to create something that can cause that feeling in someone.

              As a family trait, I also grew up fishing all over British Columbia.

              <br>over the years I picked up the art of fly tying
              <br>and began eventually selling them to friends and family! Under the name
